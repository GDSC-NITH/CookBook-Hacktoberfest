We have got all **domains** for you. Your all **valid contribution** will be joyfully welcomed whether you are a **developer** or a **competitive programmer**. All you have to do is to pick a topic that is not added to the repository, study it, and then demonstrate the information in a **Markup Documentation** file as you usually see in the official docs or websites like GFG, Javapoint, etc.

***

## These things should be there in your contribution

Create a **folder** in the **respective domain** you want to contribute. The folder will be named after the topic on which you will be writing. Create a **Markup Documentation** file there and mention the following in that file:

* About the topic
* About all properties related to topic
* Link to official docs of that topic
* Important facts related to that topic (for eg. some default properties)
* Sample code
* Output of the sample code
* Resources

***

## Keep in mind

There should be **precise** information as we are not judging you on the basis of an essay competition. It should be **easy to understand** for anyone. You should go through multiple sources of information and **study them well** before submitting.
