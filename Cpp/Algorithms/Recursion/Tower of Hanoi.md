<h1> TOWER OF HANOI ALGORIHTM</h1>

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods (A, B, and C) and N disks. 
Initially, all the disks are stacked in decreasing value of diameter i.e., the smallest disk is placed on the top and they are on rod A.

## Objective 
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod (here considered C).

## Rules of Puzzle
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
